                <p>
                    With over 7 years of experience as a Project Manager at Dexter Builders and a
                    background in conservation ecology, I bring a unique perspective to construction
                    project management. My career path has taken me from ecological research at the
                    University of Michigan to sustainability education to leading high-quality building
                    projects in the Ann Arbor area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I combine technical expertise in data analysis with hands-on project management
                    experience, focusing on delivering projects with high quality, openness, and value
                    for clients. My ecological background informs my approach to sustainable building
                    practices and understanding the broader context of construction trends.

                            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                            <p>
                                The data reveals a significant shift in homeowner behavior driven by mortgage
                                rate dynamics. Homeowners who locked in rates around 4% in 2021 are reluctant
                                to relocate when current rates hover between 6-7%. This has led to fewer total
                                projects but higher spending per project.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                "Last year we saw less spending on more projects - people were taking care of
                                deferred maintenance waiting to see if interest rates would drop. This year we
                                realized rates would not drop back to the 4% range."
                            </blockquote>
                            <h4>Ann Arbor's Resilience</h4>
                            <p>
                                While national construction spending decreased by approximately 0.5%, Ann Arbor's
                                market showed 5.5% growth. This resilience can be attributed to the jobs and
                                opportunity that the universities and their economic activity bring to the region.
                            </p>
